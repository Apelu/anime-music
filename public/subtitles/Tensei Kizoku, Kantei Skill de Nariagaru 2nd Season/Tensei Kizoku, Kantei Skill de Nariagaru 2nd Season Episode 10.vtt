WEBVTT

00:01.094 --> 00:04.601
Rebellions erupted all over
the Summerforth Empire

00:04.602 --> 00:06.735
as a result of the corrupt regime.

00:07.391 --> 00:11.624
Just as the nobles of each duchy
began to consolidate their territory,

00:11.625 --> 00:14.672
Amador Salemakhia,
duke of the Duchy of Missian

00:14.673 --> 00:15.797
died.

00:16.508 --> 00:19.711
The Duchy of Missian
was divided into two factions,

00:20.695 --> 00:23.288
led by the Duke's eldest son,
Curran Salemakhia,

00:23.289 --> 00:25.609
and the youngest son,
Basamark Salemakhia.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.102
In response to Basamark's claims
to the duke's throne

00:28.492 --> 00:33.007
and seizure of Arcantez,

00:33.008 --> 00:34.618
Curran chose to declare war.

00:35.609 --> 00:38.015
(Lamberg, Semplar, Samuk, Belzud)
Ars, the lord of Lamberg,

00:38.016 --> 00:41.187
had the Shadow mercenary group work for him

00:41.188 --> 00:44.211
and started the attack on Staatz Castle.

00:45.711 --> 00:49.432
(Episode 22: Snowball Fight)

00:52.094 --> 00:54.304
(Staatz Castle)
We can see Staatz Castle now.

00:56.898 --> 01:00.226
Get in touch with Lord Curran
and start the operation!

01:01.086 --> 01:03.422
This is the plan the group of Ars
came up with.

01:04.023 --> 01:07.109
50,000 soldiers of Curran Army's
main force encircle

01:07.500 --> 01:10.904
and troops of Ars numbering 5,000
will lay siege from the north

01:10.904 --> 01:11.789
like this.

01:12.617 --> 01:14.711
The enemy general,
the Belzud county chief,

01:14.712 --> 01:17.781
will deploy most of his mages

01:17.781 --> 01:20.831
to the south gate to
resist the main force of Curran side.

01:21.203 --> 01:22.916
Naturally, he also leave enough mages

01:22.917 --> 01:26.008
to deal with 5,000 troops
at the north gate.

01:26.508 --> 01:28.211
But at that time…

01:30.476 --> 01:32.701
The enemy miscalculated.

01:45.314 --> 01:48.776
(As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I'll Use
My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World S2)

02:59.096 --> 03:03.934
(As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I'll Use
My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World S2)

03:04.203 --> 03:06.937
(Staatz Castle)

03:08.008 --> 03:10.633
So they really did get
reinforcements from Rolto.

03:15.914 --> 03:19.407
It's only a mere 5,000 soldiers,
just as the reports said.

03:19.813 --> 03:22.015
Repel them according to the plan!

03:22.016 --> 03:23.804
Fire!

03:23.805 --> 03:24.710
Yes, sir!

03:25.219 --> 03:27.524
Defeat the invaders!

03:27.525 --> 03:28.515
Yes, sir!

03:34.898 --> 03:36.789
This is so unlike me.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.009
Captain!

03:38.009 --> 03:41.221
A mage is approaching us terribly fast!

03:41.914 --> 03:43.616
It's only one person.

03:43.617 --> 03:45.921
Magic amplifier, aim at them!

03:47.414 --> 03:48.436
Fire!

03:50.414 --> 03:52.710
Forma Igni Irrupt!

03:58.109 --> 04:01.280
The 5,000 soldiers
under the command of Ars

04:01.281 --> 04:03.326
were no ordinary soldiers.

04:04.797 --> 04:06.312
I may be the only one,

04:06.313 --> 04:10.015
but I alone am worth a hundred!

04:21.601 --> 04:22.218
Very well.

04:22.594 --> 04:23.492
Ars.

04:23.492 --> 04:24.211
Yes.

04:25.008 --> 04:26.499
Charge, everyone!

04:26.500 --> 04:27.617
Charge forward!

04:31.695 --> 04:32.904
Mr. Clamant

04:32.905 --> 04:34.992
and the Maitro Mercenary Group,

04:34.993 --> 04:37.038
please lead the attack.

04:37.609 --> 04:38.609
Then open the south gate from the inside,

04:38.610 --> 04:41.804
so Lord Curran can go in.

04:41.805 --> 04:44.519
Would you be willing to
take on this dangerous mission?

04:44.891 --> 04:46.036
Leave it to us.

04:47.796 --> 04:50.390
Also, to help them defeat the enemy, we
will follow behind them into the castle.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.713
Miss Charlotte, Mr. Rietz!

04:57.516 --> 04:58.423
You guys are truly amazing!

05:01.711 --> 05:03.491
Mr. Rietz and Miss Mireille,

05:03.492 --> 05:06.598
kindly direct the army to the front lines.

05:07.023 --> 05:09.017
You're in charge of leading them.

05:09.406 --> 05:12.195
The wall broke! The enemy's coming!

05:12.196 --> 05:14.897
If they open the south gate from inside,

05:14.898 --> 05:17.375
and let the Curran army invade…

05:17.375 --> 05:20.539
We'll be done for!

05:22.602 --> 05:24.700
Looks like they're in high spirits.

05:27.311 --> 05:30.398
(The Young Soldier of Staatz Castle)

05:30.399 --> 05:32.898
Things are finally getting interesting.

05:33.898 --> 05:36.898
(Staatz Castle, North Gate)

05:38.109 --> 05:40.726
Attack!

05:42.695 --> 05:44.132
Charge!

05:45.195 --> 05:46.898
Defeat the enemy!

05:46.898 --> 05:48.695
Defend!

05:55.906 --> 05:58.195
Tomas isn't here, right?

05:58.195 --> 05:59.632
There're so many of them.

06:00.488 --> 06:01.499
Rietz!

06:01.500 --> 06:03.992
The number doesn't matter.

06:06.297 --> 06:08.515
We just have to take them all down

06:08.516 --> 06:11.000
for the sake of the victory of Lord Ars!

06:13.101 --> 06:14.500
Who is that?

06:16.797 --> 06:18.195
He's so strong!

06:20.505 --> 06:23.633
Not only did they break the wall,
we're also getting pushed back.

06:25.016 --> 06:26.508
We're already done for.

06:29.516 --> 06:30.997
We surrender!

06:32.695 --> 06:33.804
Captain.

06:33.805 --> 06:35.664
Please spare the lives of my subordinates

06:35.665 --> 06:37.731
and take them captive.

06:38.201 --> 06:39.435
Smart decision.

06:39.913 --> 06:41.699
Everyone, throw down your weapon…

06:41.700 --> 06:44.028
Hey, wait a minute!

06:44.710 --> 06:46.907
You guys are so excited to fight

06:47.515 --> 06:48.914
that I want to join in!

06:49.891 --> 06:52.399
Ouch!

06:54.092 --> 06:56.483
Don't make a mess of this!

06:56.484 --> 06:58.187
Shut up and stand back like a good boy!

06:58.188 --> 06:59.007
No way!

06:59.008 --> 07:00.601
It's not fair if only you get to fight!

07:01.711 --> 07:02.921
Who are you?

07:03.210 --> 07:04.907
Good question.

07:05.203 --> 07:07.227
My name is Braham Joe!

07:07.227 --> 07:09.304
Born and raised in Belzud!

07:09.304 --> 07:10.222
I'm…

07:12.492 --> 07:15.017
Um…

07:15.018 --> 07:16.304
17 years old!

07:16.305 --> 07:18.200
I said we're surrendering!

07:18.200 --> 07:19.921
Shut up!

07:21.113 --> 07:23.125
I wasn't done talking yet!

07:25.594 --> 07:27.313
Listen properly!

07:28.781 --> 07:31.905
They call me the "malignant boy
of Staatz Castle".

07:31.906 --> 07:33.406
You'll have to go through me!

07:33.797 --> 07:35.622
Don't let him get close to Mr. Rietz!

07:35.906 --> 07:37.624
Out of my way!

07:38.297 --> 07:40.126
W-What crazy power!

07:41.406 --> 07:42.795
Hey, you Marca!

07:43.117 --> 07:45.491
You're the strongest here, aren't you?

07:45.492 --> 07:47.133
Fight me!

07:48.296 --> 07:51.121
Sure, bring it on!

07:52.507 --> 07:54.640
F-Follow Joe!

08:07.797 --> 08:10.008
I knew you are strong!

08:11.102 --> 08:14.187
Everyone in this castle is weaker than me.

08:14.188 --> 08:16.506
Nobody could match me at all.

08:16.507 --> 08:18.610
It's been a long time
since I met someone strong.

08:18.611 --> 08:20.041
I am so happy!

08:20.703 --> 08:23.515
I see. Honestly speaking,

08:24.719 --> 08:29.422
of all the fights I've ever had,
this appears to be the most boring.

08:30.296 --> 08:34.921
Fighting with me is boring?

08:35.398 --> 08:36.117
Yeah.

08:37.891 --> 08:38.935
But I am

08:40.406 --> 08:42.687
the strongest person in this castle!

08:42.688 --> 08:46.116
There's just no way fighting me
could bore you!

08:46.117 --> 08:47.819
But that's just how it is.

08:50.992 --> 08:53.101
You depend only on strength and intuition.

08:53.102 --> 08:54.711
You're not skilled.

09:02.094 --> 09:03.508
Ouch!

09:05.000 --> 09:07.202
Your field of view is far too narrow.

09:07.203 --> 09:09.422
You're getting tricked
by even the simplest feints.

09:12.305 --> 09:13.727
You have talent,

09:14.102 --> 09:16.515
so why fight in a way
that makes no use of it?

09:24.016 --> 09:26.400
Huh, it's over?

09:27.211 --> 09:28.193
Miss Mireille.

09:28.194 --> 09:30.031
Good job.

09:30.032 --> 09:31.499
Well done.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.695
It seems everything here is resolved.

09:33.695 --> 09:34.812
Thank you.

09:35.297 --> 09:36.409
Mr. Rietz…

09:36.410 --> 09:37.911
It is not a deep enough cut!

09:41.101 --> 09:42.718
Don't give up!

09:42.719 --> 09:44.110
Come on, stand up!

09:44.703 --> 09:47.234
Huh? He's giving an enemy a lesson?

09:48.391 --> 09:49.297
(Braham Joe, 17 years old, male)

09:49.297 --> 09:50.695
(likes fighting
likes young and strong women)

09:53.102 --> 09:55.118
Your fighting style is frankly the worst.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.694
A warrior is someone

10:02.695 --> 10:05.897
who trains day after day,
constantly pushing their own limits.

10:06.703 --> 10:08.922
If you just want to act like
a big shot because you're strong,

10:09.383 --> 10:11.236
you'd better give up on
ever becoming a soldier.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.622
I-I'm sorry, Lord Ars!

10:22.623 --> 10:24.069
I ended up training an enemy!

10:24.070 --> 10:25.001
Ma-

10:25.391 --> 10:26.543
Master!

10:27.812 --> 10:28.804
Please!

10:31.297 --> 10:33.625
Take me as your disciple!

10:34.414 --> 10:35.585
What?

10:35.586 --> 10:38.194
What are you saying?
We are enemies, aren't we?

10:38.195 --> 10:39.921
Right, then I …

10:40.313 --> 10:41.211
decide to side with you.

10:42.406 --> 10:45.804
No, wait! Why should
I even make you my disciple?

10:45.805 --> 10:47.905
I wanna be a lot stronger!

10:47.906 --> 10:49.899
I can start as your luggage carrier.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.202
Okay? It's fine, right?

10:51.203 --> 10:52.648
Please!

10:52.648 --> 10:54.406
It's just impossible!

10:54.407 --> 10:55.515
Okay!

10:56.289 --> 10:58.533
Please! By all means, join us!

10:59.102 --> 11:00.219
Lord Ars?

11:03.014 --> 11:05.804
(Braham Joe, 17 years old, male)
He's crazy talented!

11:05.805 --> 11:08.913
(Intellect 61, Currently 6)
His Intellect is a bit low…

11:08.914 --> 11:10.999
(Prowess 92, Command 102)
but his maximum Prowess and Command

11:11.000 --> 11:12.609
(Prowess 92, Command 102)
surpass Mr. Rietz's!

11:14.703 --> 11:15.953
I'm sure you could

11:15.954 --> 11:18.219
make him realize his talent, Mr. Rietz!

11:18.602 --> 11:19.367
(Joe) (Shake)
Shake.

11:19.367 --> 11:20.109
(Woof)
Woof!

11:20.508 --> 11:21.304
Go!

11:21.305 --> 11:22.204
(Woof)
Woof woof!

11:22.695 --> 11:25.711
I'm sure you could tell
he was talented as well, Mr. Rietz.

11:26.094 --> 11:29.731
I acknowledge he has talent, but…

11:30.797 --> 11:32.796
Master, who is this brat?

11:32.797 --> 11:34.289
He's not a brat!

11:34.290 --> 11:35.952
It's Lord Ars Louvent.

11:35.953 --> 11:37.822
The person I serve.

11:41.211 --> 11:43.086
(Joe's imagination)
The master of my master?

11:43.087 --> 11:45.399
Does that mean he's
stronger than Mr. Rietz?

11:46.906 --> 11:48.499
The master of my master!

11:48.500 --> 11:50.390
I'm Braham Joe.

11:50.391 --> 11:51.919
I'll be in your care from now on.

11:52.305 --> 11:55.914
I'm Ars. Nice to meet you.

11:58.797 --> 11:59.636
Mr. Rietz…

12:01.000 --> 12:02.219
Master!

12:02.898 --> 12:04.015
Mr. Rietz…

12:05.281 --> 12:07.616
Since you say so, Lord Ars…

12:07.625 --> 12:08.898
Thank you.

12:09.914 --> 12:12.022
Let's get going since it's decided.

12:12.023 --> 12:14.734
Make way. Mr. Rietz is coming through!

12:16.211 --> 12:18.196
I can finally see you, big brother.

12:21.086 --> 12:22.534
Huh?

12:22.898 --> 12:25.515
There appears to be
a new, interesting child.

12:26.992 --> 12:28.117
You are…

12:28.414 --> 12:31.305
The torturing demon, Mireille Grandione!

12:32.210 --> 12:35.156
Many of the people she tortures

12:35.157 --> 12:37.399
ended up as cripples!

12:37.400 --> 12:38.485
This is bad!

12:38.486 --> 12:40.211
Never being able to function again,

12:40.212 --> 12:41.836
be it physically or mentally!

12:43.101 --> 12:43.789
Please!

12:43.789 --> 12:46.210
We will tell you the deployment of the
soldiers and the location of the traps!

12:46.211 --> 12:48.515
Please don't torture us!

12:48.516 --> 12:51.202
Really? Thanks.

12:51.203 --> 12:54.312
Was Miss Mireille that scary?

12:55.210 --> 12:58.109
(Staatz Castle, Trap Room)

13:00.374 --> 13:02.108
We disabled the traps!

13:02.304 --> 13:05.297
(Staatz Castle, South Gate)

13:11.906 --> 13:13.234
Charge!

13:15.281 --> 13:17.726
With the main force
of Curran Army charging in,

13:18.289 --> 13:22.914
the lord of Staatz Castle, Kanses Bandol,
fled right away.

13:23.500 --> 13:28.398
Curran side successfully
captured Staatz Castle.

13:35.602 --> 13:37.711
(Arcantez Castle)
The Duchy of Missian succession war

13:38.313 --> 13:41.024
entered its final stages.

13:48.117 --> 13:51.937
We have finally succeeded
in capturing Staatz Castle.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.890
(Gaze of Suspicion)
You've all done well.

13:54.891 --> 13:58.094
Especially Ars Louvent here.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.405
He not only captured Rolto Castle

14:00.406 --> 14:03.297
and saved my life
by sending mercenaries,

14:03.594 --> 14:06.508
but was also the key to
conquering Staatz Castle.

14:06.508 --> 14:08.101
Yay, the master of my master!

14:08.102 --> 14:09.407
Give him a hand!

14:11.211 --> 14:14.228
We all worked together!
Thank you very much!

14:28.007 --> 14:30.202
It was predicted to snow,
but this amount of snow was overwhelming.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.537
Yeah.

14:33.906 --> 14:34.804
I'm coming in.

14:35.813 --> 14:38.211
Ars, you're finally here.

14:43.797 --> 14:47.226
Don't mind them,
they're just my bodyguards.

14:47.233 --> 14:50.605
Allow me to repeat how big
a contribution you made this time.

14:50.606 --> 14:53.492
Not at all, it's all thanks
to everyone's efforts.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.030
A young lord like you

14:56.031 --> 14:58.101
can have so many accomplishments,

14:58.102 --> 14:59.500
which is completely unprecedented.

14:59.906 --> 15:02.101
You possess exceptional courage
and wisdom.

15:02.102 --> 15:06.125
And then you have that mysterious power
to gauge people's abilities.

15:09.406 --> 15:12.312
Just who are you?

15:14.094 --> 15:14.789
Or rather…

15:15.898 --> 15:17.616
What are you hiding?

15:18.906 --> 15:20.414
Huh?

15:21.109 --> 15:23.414
What happened to Lord Curran?

15:23.789 --> 15:25.800
He feels so different from usual.

15:26.804 --> 15:29.704
Does he think I'm
after the throne or something?

15:30.797 --> 15:32.304
No, maybe…

15:32.305 --> 15:36.297
He noticed that I'm not from this world?

15:38.601 --> 15:41.304
I'm just an ordinary lord.

15:41.906 --> 15:43.000
That's right.

15:43.492 --> 15:44.986
But you've done so much

15:45.403 --> 15:48.812
and worked so hard,
surely you have some kind of goal.

15:49.602 --> 15:51.523
Don't lie to me.

15:53.711 --> 15:55.246
I do have a goal.

15:56.203 --> 15:57.498
What is it?

15:59.219 --> 16:01.294
I have only one goal.

16:02.109 --> 16:03.593
And it's to make a world where my people

16:03.594 --> 16:06.438
can live peacefully and happily.

16:07.711 --> 16:11.804
I don't know why I have this power.

16:12.602 --> 16:14.608
But I was born as the son of lord

16:14.609 --> 16:16.797
and the day I inherited
the fief from my father,

16:17.414 --> 16:19.710
I decided to use this power

16:20.109 --> 16:21.304
for the sake of the people.

16:27.304 --> 16:30.313
I see! You answered
just as I expected you to.

16:32.789 --> 16:34.410
Why do you look so shocked?

16:34.617 --> 16:37.515
It's just that my vassals
have been noisy as of late.

16:37.516 --> 16:40.110
They keep asking who you are.

16:41.289 --> 16:44.625
Many suspected that

16:45.203 --> 16:49.015
you were planning to usurp the throne.

16:50.180 --> 16:53.399
Of course I never believed that.

16:54.234 --> 16:56.015
I would never!

16:56.688 --> 16:58.108
My anxious vassals should rest easy

16:58.109 --> 17:01.601
after hearing what you just said.

17:01.602 --> 17:02.922
Well, as the saying goes…

17:03.297 --> 17:06.609
"If you stand out,
people are sure to notice you."

17:07.320 --> 17:11.008
And you stand out the most in all
of the Duchy of Missian right now.

17:16.305 --> 17:18.297
I expect great things from you, Ars.

17:19.914 --> 17:20.805
Yes, sir!

17:25.313 --> 17:27.618
T-That was nerve-wracking!

17:28.391 --> 17:31.000
It was really terrifying.

17:33.406 --> 17:36.617
What would've happened
if I gave the wrong answer?

17:41.602 --> 17:45.616
But it's a fact that there are people
out there who don't like me.

17:45.617 --> 17:47.031
I need to be careful.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.008
What's going on?

17:51.492 --> 17:54.616
I shot down Ars Louvent!

17:54.617 --> 17:56.909
Miss Charlotte, what are you doing?

17:56.910 --> 18:00.403
There's just so much snow.
No way I'm not gonna play.

18:00.703 --> 18:03.390
It's my first time seeing snow.

18:03.391 --> 18:05.793
Look! It's so white!

18:07.093 --> 18:08.418
How silly.

18:09.125 --> 18:11.328
We may be taking a rest,
but we're still at war.

18:11.707 --> 18:14.621
What would you do if you caught a cold
and affected the next fight?

18:15.805 --> 18:18.735
I took down Rietz Muses as well!

18:21.695 --> 18:22.788
M-Mr. Rietz?

18:22.789 --> 18:24.110
Come, Joe!

18:24.317 --> 18:25.320
Counterattack!

18:25.320 --> 18:26.328
Yes, Master.

18:26.508 --> 18:28.297
Come and fight!

18:32.719 --> 18:35.488
Attack them from both the right and the left.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.616
Okay, break through the center!

18:37.616 --> 18:39.906
Master, look! I made some giant snowballs.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.702
I-It kind of lively.

18:42.703 --> 18:46.093
Come now! Will team west or team east win?

18:46.094 --> 18:48.501
Team west has better odds right now.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.937
Come, make a bet!

18:50.203 --> 18:52.407
Mr. Fahm, what are you doing?

18:52.408 --> 18:53.415
Ars.

18:53.711 --> 18:55.758
I may like gambling,

18:55.759 --> 18:57.899
but I like making money even more.

19:01.398 --> 19:03.898
Jeez. What a noisy bunch.

19:04.312 --> 19:07.897
Are you going to join, Mr. Clamant?

19:07.898 --> 19:08.891
No.

19:09.797 --> 19:12.500
Miss, you sure can drink.

19:13.406 --> 19:14.904
You too.

19:15.211 --> 19:17.414
Want to see who can drink the fastest?

19:20.398 --> 19:21.687
Everyone, look!

19:21.688 --> 19:22.711
It's huge!

19:22.711 --> 19:24.406
Nicely done.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.801
Charlotte, wait!

19:32.906 --> 19:34.673
Rietz, you went and broke it.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.421
It's your fault!
You're the one who ran away!

19:36.422 --> 19:37.991
I'm sorry, Rosell.

19:37.992 --> 19:40.601
I-It's fine. I don't mind at all.

19:41.609 --> 19:42.929
I don't…

19:44.703 --> 19:46.804
I'm really sorry!

19:46.805 --> 19:48.187
I call a truce!

19:48.195 --> 19:50.531
We all have to remake the snowman!

19:51.117 --> 19:52.399
That means you shall help too, Charlotte!

19:52.609 --> 19:54.609
Well then.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.000
Amazing! It's even bigger than before!

20:15.001 --> 20:16.296
Thank you!

20:16.297 --> 20:17.397
Hey, you!

20:17.398 --> 20:19.718
The fight got called off,
so the bets are invalid!

20:19.719 --> 20:21.438
Give us back our money!

20:21.992 --> 20:27.804
Give us back our money…

20:27.805 --> 20:30.719
They got away with shadow magic!

20:31.008 --> 20:32.304
Stop, wait!

20:32.508 --> 20:33.516
Mr. Fahm…

20:37.797 --> 20:39.024
Hey Ars.

20:39.391 --> 20:41.094
When does it snow, actually?

20:41.594 --> 20:43.289
Will it keep snowing?

20:43.289 --> 20:45.523
Only in winter.

20:45.906 --> 20:48.016
So it's just for now?

20:48.992 --> 20:52.015
I want to see it again
with everyone next year.

20:57.102 --> 20:58.829
(You're gonna catch a cold)
You're gonna catch a cold.

20:58.829 --> 21:00.467
(Achoo)

21:00.468 --> 21:02.398
(These two are monsters)
These two are monsters…

21:02.399 --> 21:03.609
This is nice!

21:04.554 --> 21:05.805
(Snore) (Lord Lenge...)

21:05.806 --> 21:08.476
(Snore) (Lord Lenge...)
Lord Lenge…

21:12.688 --> 21:15.900
Next year and every year after that,

21:16.484 --> 21:18.402
I will protect their smiles.

21:25.297 --> 21:28.602
Mireille figured out my whole plan.

21:29.797 --> 21:32.235
She's undoubtedly a genius.

21:32.891 --> 21:35.399
But if I continue to fail…

21:35.797 --> 21:36.796
I…

21:37.406 --> 21:38.630
Lord Tomas…

21:41.218 --> 21:43.203
That's not like you at all.

21:43.898 --> 21:44.711
Tomas.

21:47.789 --> 21:49.433
Lord Basamark.

23:25.508 --> 23:27.000
We are having a great time.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.265
You…

23:28.266 --> 23:30.117
Relax, it is okay once in a while, right?

23:30.117 --> 23:31.718
Lord Ars is also very pleased.

23:31.719 --> 23:32.914
That's true, indeed.

23:32.914 --> 23:34.382
But don't let your guard down, okay?

23:34.383 --> 23:35.586
Yeah, yeah.

23:35.586 --> 23:37.703
Let's show them our strength.

23:37.703 --> 23:39.297
