WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:02.460
(Grandione House)

00:07.000 --> 00:10.010
You both have superb skills.

00:11.210 --> 00:13.600
(Tomas Grandione)
You could do that?

00:13.990 --> 00:16.910
(Mireille Grandione)
I predicted all your moves, Tomas.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.510
Let's play another round.

00:23.110 --> 00:27.230
Mireille was always
several steps ahead of me.

00:27.950 --> 00:29.980
(Military Academy Junior Division,
Duchy of Missian)

00:34.000 --> 00:38.030
She was smart, and also very capable.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.780
No matter how hard I tried,

00:46.790 --> 00:49.210
I couldn't win against Mireille.

00:53.490 --> 00:56.510
(Arcantez Castle)
It stayed that way even after
I started serving the Duke.

00:59.500 --> 01:03.710
I'm always walking
in the shadow of Mireille.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.510
Mireille is a genius.

01:06.910 --> 01:09.230
That is an undeniable fact.

01:09.990 --> 01:10.730
However,

01:11.500 --> 01:14.410
the contempt for my father was wrong.

01:15.090 --> 01:16.290
My father was an outstanding man

01:16.290 --> 01:18.820
who never betrayed his loyalty.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.890
As long as I win against Mireille,

01:21.890 --> 01:24.220
I can prove that I am right.

01:29.890 --> 01:33.120
But then, that day suddenly came.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.510
Mireille Grandione, you are banished.

01:39.710 --> 01:41.300
I've messed it up.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.310
(Episode 23: Loyalty)

01:46.310 --> 01:48.300
Tomas Grandione,

01:49.100 --> 01:51.300
as the Duke of the Duchy of Missian,

01:51.300 --> 01:53.900
I appoint you as my adviser.

01:55.210 --> 01:58.930
I obey your command, Lord Amador.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.790
From now on, I rely on you.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.630
Do fulfill your duty.

02:04.100 --> 02:04.800
Yes.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.280
I have finally won against her.

02:07.890 --> 02:10.420
It is the result of serving loyally
just like my father.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I was right.

02:14.390 --> 02:16.120
I thought so.

02:28.390 --> 02:32.000
(As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I'll Use
My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World S2)

03:42.090 --> 03:46.970
(As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I'll Use
My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World S2)

03:47.500 --> 03:50.810
Mireille figured out my whole plan.

03:51.990 --> 03:54.400
She is undoubtedly a genius.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.630
But if I continue to fail…

03:58.010 --> 03:58.900
I…

03:59.710 --> 04:00.900
Lord Tomas…

04:03.410 --> 04:05.400
This isn't like you at all.

04:06.090 --> 04:06.920
Tomas.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.620
(Basamark Salemakhia)
Lord Basamark.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.910
Curran and the others will
arrive in Belzud soon.

04:17.410 --> 04:21.030
I wanted to check up on you before that.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.410
I am sorry!

04:25.900 --> 04:28.160
Next time, I will help you have a victory…

04:28.160 --> 04:30.430
I heard that Mireille was serving Curran.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.810
No wonder it's such a hard battle.

04:34.710 --> 04:37.210
Tomas, lift your head.

04:39.190 --> 04:41.610
I know you are loyal.

04:42.110 --> 04:44.280
Just like your father,

04:44.280 --> 04:47.710
you are more devoted
to our Duchy than anyone.

04:48.210 --> 04:50.720
How could I blame you?

04:54.690 --> 04:57.030
Just like you,

04:57.790 --> 04:59.280
I am devoted to Duchy of Missian.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.750
To protect my late father's legacy,

05:01.750 --> 05:03.010
I chose to draw my sword.

05:06.110 --> 05:08.200
For our homeland,

05:08.200 --> 05:11.010
we must defeat Curran.

05:12.410 --> 05:13.810
Lord Basamark…

05:16.400 --> 05:19.300
I'm counting on you, Tomas.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.010
Yes.

05:21.590 --> 05:23.310
(Staatz Castle)
Next, we'll attack Belzud Castle,

05:23.310 --> 05:26.890
the most important stronghold of Belzud,
one of the three major cities.

05:26.890 --> 05:27.620
Yes.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.500
(Attacking Belzud)
When we attacked Staatz Castle,

05:30.500 --> 05:33.210
Tomas came personally to assassinate me.

05:33.910 --> 05:36.890
(Samuk Castle, Rolto Castle, Staatz Castle)
That means they have been driven to desperation.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.000
In Belzud,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.620
they will charge at us desperately.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.010
Everyone, I'm counting on you.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.220
Yes.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.800
Are we finally going to
face Mr. Tomas head-on?

05:50.210 --> 05:52.030
That means Miss Mireille…

05:55.100 --> 05:56.220
Excuse me.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.220
Someone claimed to be a messenger
of the Belzud county chief.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.520
He wants to meet Lord Curran.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.210
I came by the order of
the Belzud county chief,

06:04.610 --> 06:07.520
Lord Kanses Bandol.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.320
What is the message?

06:10.780 --> 06:12.610
He wants to know

06:13.110 --> 06:15.710
if you can call a truce on the war.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.330
A truce at this point?

06:21.200 --> 06:25.710
Lord Kanses does not
want any more casualties.

06:26.890 --> 06:28.400
Seeing that defeat is imminent

06:28.400 --> 06:29.710
but unwilling to surrender,

06:29.710 --> 06:31.600
he's hoping for a truce?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.510
No.

06:33.910 --> 06:36.920
It's your side that
will suffer casualties.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.710
What do you mean?

06:39.490 --> 06:43.420
We have successfully
developed a large-scale weapon,

06:44.300 --> 06:46.300
a super catalyst machine,

06:46.300 --> 06:50.100
and magic that can destroy
a city in one strike.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.390
If we get serious,

06:52.390 --> 06:55.710
we can turn this area to ashes.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.210
Assuming it does exist,

07:00.210 --> 07:01.600
why don't you use it?

07:02.110 --> 07:04.090
We cannot bear to destroy the territory
and slaughter people,

07:04.090 --> 07:08.420
not even for a victory.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.310
But if the war continues,

07:13.310 --> 07:16.590
we will have no choice but to use it.

07:16.590 --> 07:19.810
That's why we request a truce.

07:20.710 --> 07:23.290
I cannot believe your words right away.

07:23.290 --> 07:24.610
Give me some time.

07:25.610 --> 07:28.310
That is obviously a bluff.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.410
You are right.

07:31.210 --> 07:33.800
Have you heard about a large weapon?

07:34.210 --> 07:36.500
The former Duke never mentioned it.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.500
Besides, with Belzud's capability,

07:39.500 --> 07:42.190
they shouldn't be able to
create such powerful weapons.

07:42.190 --> 07:44.500
Who would believe that?

07:44.500 --> 07:47.900
Frankly, I think it's not
even worth considering.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.630
That's true.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.600
Okay, then we will refuse this request

07:53.600 --> 07:54.800
and ask the messenger to return.

07:55.200 --> 07:55.920
Yes.

08:00.290 --> 08:01.890
What's wrong, Rosell?

08:02.310 --> 08:03.510
Nothing.

08:03.510 --> 08:07.300
I just think it's too rash
to call it a bluff.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.110
They should know that
a bluff like that would not work.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.410
Mr. Tomas is with them, isn't he?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.910
Could they have another purpose?

08:17.100 --> 08:18.410
I don't know either.

08:18.810 --> 08:21.390
Um, could you tell me more

08:21.390 --> 08:23.510
about you and Mr. Tomas?

08:24.500 --> 08:26.210
Why do you suddenly ask?

08:26.210 --> 08:28.390
Thinking from the enemy's perspective.

08:28.390 --> 08:31.200
Isn't that what you taught me?

08:31.590 --> 08:33.790
That's true, but…

08:34.210 --> 08:36.100
Why did Mr. Tomas and you

08:36.110 --> 08:38.100
become tacticians?

08:38.500 --> 08:41.410
We just went along with the tide.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.300
(Head of the Grandione Family)

08:43.300 --> 08:45.820
(Edward Grandione)
What is going on?

08:46.310 --> 08:48.090
(The Grandione Siblings)
You have committed the crime of treason

08:48.090 --> 08:49.690
(The Grandione Siblings)
and will be sentenced to death.

08:49.690 --> 08:50.900
Please wait.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.490
I could never commit treason.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.500
Many people have informed
on you to Lord Duke.

08:58.100 --> 09:02.200
From today, the Grandione family
will be stripped of their nobility.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.710
What did Lord Duke say?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.580
I have petitioned many times.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.800
I am sorry, but this decision
will not change.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.000
Please wait!

09:13.100 --> 09:17.490
At least hear out my final request.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.500
All right.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.100
I will hear what you have to say.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.810
Thank you.

09:27.190 --> 09:29.500
I have two children.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.110
Could you please promote them?

09:34.890 --> 09:37.620
If that's not possible,

09:38.300 --> 09:40.620
please kill them.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.420
You want us to kill the children?

09:44.110 --> 09:47.100
Different from me, they are outstanding.

09:47.100 --> 09:50.710
And that makes them dangerous.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.600
If their nobility is stripped away

09:53.600 --> 09:55.300
and you hand them over to another Duchy,

09:55.800 --> 09:56.800
eventually,

09:56.800 --> 09:59.800
they may become a threat
to Duchy of Missian.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.780
Father must have been framed.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.890
He is so loyal that
he would even kill his heirs.

10:15.890 --> 10:18.510
How could he possibly betray the Duke?

10:18.510 --> 10:20.200
That's impossible!

10:20.200 --> 10:21.890
Right, Mireille?

10:22.280 --> 10:24.910
This has become quite a headache.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.400
Why are you so calm?

10:28.400 --> 10:30.710
We might die.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.720
Think about it.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.800
Regardless of Father's plea,

10:34.800 --> 10:36.690
the Duke decided to execute him.

10:36.690 --> 10:38.710
Given that, how could he possibly believe

10:38.710 --> 10:40.510
his claim that we should be killed?

10:47.100 --> 10:49.390
Then, my father was executed.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.730
Tomas and I were demoted to commoners.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.810
Just let them go.

10:56.810 --> 10:58.880
Although they are the family of a traitor,

10:58.880 --> 11:01.100
now they are just commoners.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.120
Taking them seriously would be ridiculous.

11:13.490 --> 11:16.210
Ow…

11:19.710 --> 11:22.510
It's great we weren't killed, Tomas.

11:23.710 --> 11:26.920
Living on like this is meaningless.

11:27.210 --> 11:29.520
Father was too stubborn.

11:29.880 --> 11:33.400
Better to flee than to be killed.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.500
How stupid.

11:35.790 --> 11:37.310
Don't say that!

11:37.600 --> 11:39.510
Father is not stupid!

11:41.000 --> 11:43.310
You should be fine if you can be so loud.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.720
Tomas, we have lost our home and parents.

11:55.010 --> 11:58.090
But we still have our minds and voices.

11:58.090 --> 11:59.490
With these weapons,

11:59.490 --> 12:01.300
we can survive.

12:04.780 --> 12:07.010
We are no longer nobles.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.580
Thank goodness, Tomas.

12:15.580 --> 12:18.320
We don't have to wear
these stiff clothes anymore.

12:22.190 --> 12:24.500
We're no longer nobles.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.900
In order to survive,

12:25.900 --> 12:28.420
we entered a military school
for commoners.

12:29.010 --> 12:32.010
Then we became tacticians.

12:32.010 --> 12:35.300
Tomas has always hated me.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.280
He was always chasing after me.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.000
It's really annoying.

12:39.490 --> 12:42.410
What a past you've had.

12:42.410 --> 12:44.610
That's enough talk.

12:44.610 --> 12:46.710
I'm going to have a drink.

12:49.510 --> 12:52.890
(Belzud Castle)

12:52.900 --> 12:55.900
Hurry, set off once you're ready.

12:56.390 --> 12:57.520
Tomas.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.210
Are you really going?

13:01.210 --> 13:01.900
Yes.

13:02.690 --> 13:05.210
Staatz Castle is now occupied.

13:05.210 --> 13:07.780
There won't be reinforcements.

13:07.780 --> 13:09.890
- The situation is…
- Lord Kanses.

13:10.700 --> 13:14.410
I am simply being loyal to Lord Basamark.

13:20.110 --> 13:23.300
I must win against Mireille this time

13:23.300 --> 13:25.510
and put an end to our grudge.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.000
Is the preparation going well?

13:29.000 --> 13:32.010
Yes, the reinforcements are almost here.

13:32.020 --> 13:32.900
Very good.

13:32.900 --> 13:35.210
Inform me immediately if anything happens.

13:35.210 --> 13:36.390
Lord Curran!

13:36.390 --> 13:37.310
What is it?

13:37.310 --> 13:39.020
The scouts have sent a report.

13:39.380 --> 13:42.690
A large weapon has been spotted
on the hills of Belzud.

13:42.690 --> 13:43.990
What?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.200
The scouts have sent a report.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.910
A large weapon has been spotted
on the hills of Belzud.

13:52.910 --> 13:55.430
Isn't that a hoax?

13:55.430 --> 13:57.650
With Belzud's financial resources
and technology,

13:57.660 --> 13:58.790
it shouldn't be possible.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.890
(Feeling Familiar)
What do you think?

14:03.900 --> 14:06.000
(Feeling Familiar)
Is it really a weapon?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.710
To be honest, it's suspicious.

14:08.490 --> 14:10.430
It must be a bluff.

14:10.430 --> 14:12.510
They must have created a fake one

14:12.510 --> 14:14.990
to confuse us.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.390
I think so too.

14:16.390 --> 14:18.690
What if it's really a weapon?

14:18.690 --> 14:21.020
We could be in danger.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.990
You believed it without an investigation?

14:23.990 --> 14:25.190
Are you fools?

14:25.190 --> 14:26.710
- What?
- What did you call us?

14:26.720 --> 14:28.780
To clarify that,

14:28.780 --> 14:30.490
can we ask them to investigate?

14:30.490 --> 14:31.790
Ask whom?

14:31.790 --> 14:33.910
The local scouts have already returned.

14:34.290 --> 14:38.110
Alright, then I'll ask Mr. Fahm.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.810
Young master sure knows
how to order people around.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.400
That's the large weapon they spoke of.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.020
Report.

14:59.790 --> 15:02.110
The large weapon is fake.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.010
What?

15:05.210 --> 15:06.910
After a thorough investigation,

15:06.910 --> 15:11.210
no magic water channel necessary
for casting magic was found.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.390
Nor did we see any Mages.

15:13.390 --> 15:14.310
I see.

15:14.310 --> 15:15.700
That is to say,

15:15.700 --> 15:18.420
they sent envoys
to urge us to cease the war

15:18.420 --> 15:20.530
just to stall for time?

15:20.990 --> 15:21.720
Huh?

15:22.280 --> 15:24.210
But it's strange if that's the case.

15:24.210 --> 15:26.010
Rosell, what is it?

15:26.010 --> 15:27.990
Even if the enemy has more time,

15:27.990 --> 15:28.890
geographically,

15:28.890 --> 15:31.210
they can't call for reinforcements
from Belzud Castle.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.210
On the contrary, we'd be able to
increase our reinforcements.

15:35.210 --> 15:38.080
For them, it would be
more disadvantageous.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.300
That makes sense.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.290
Moreover, do they really think

15:41.290 --> 15:44.610
we would fall for the fake weapon?

15:45.100 --> 15:47.310
Our opponent is Mr. Tomas.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.210
Regarding that,

15:49.600 --> 15:52.610
the enemy has reinforced
the defenses of Belzde Castle.

15:53.210 --> 15:56.490
Is that what they were stalling for?

15:56.890 --> 15:57.810
It appears so.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.230
Still, it's better not to give
the enemy any more time.

16:01.700 --> 16:03.890
But this situation

16:03.890 --> 16:05.920
feels somewhat familiar.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.990
A super catalyst machine

16:08.990 --> 16:12.800
and magic that can destroy
a city in one strike.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.220
- Well then, everyone go prepare…
- Please wait!

16:16.600 --> 16:17.490
What is it?

16:17.490 --> 16:21.210
I've encountered this situation before.

16:21.210 --> 16:25.200
A lie about a secret weapon
was also exposed?

16:25.200 --> 16:27.010
No, it's not like that.

16:27.010 --> 16:28.390
I understand, young master.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.410
You mean that mock battle, right?

16:31.410 --> 16:34.010
Yes! The mock battle!

16:34.510 --> 16:35.490
At that time,

16:35.490 --> 16:38.000
Miss Mireille had the soldiers surrender

16:38.000 --> 16:39.900
and released false information

16:39.900 --> 16:41.620
to lure us into attacking.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.390
This time, the opponents also sent envoys

16:44.390 --> 16:46.490
to give out fake information
that was easily exposed

16:46.490 --> 16:48.100
to entice us to attack.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.000
It's the same battle plan.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.010
What are you talking about?

16:52.320 --> 16:54.490
So, my brother Tomas

16:54.490 --> 16:56.760
intentionally let us expose them

16:56.760 --> 16:58.010
to lure us into attacking.

16:58.010 --> 16:59.100
He wants to defeat us

16:59.100 --> 17:01.300
when we are careless.

17:01.900 --> 17:02.810
I see.

17:03.380 --> 17:06.710
Did he come up with this plan
because he believes in your intelligence?

17:07.280 --> 17:08.380
If that's the case,

17:08.380 --> 17:11.530
the enemy should set an ambush.

17:11.910 --> 17:14.490
On the route to Belzud Castle,

17:14.490 --> 17:16.110
the troops will be stretched out.

17:16.110 --> 17:18.000
The place that's vulnerable to ambush

17:18.790 --> 17:19.700
is right here.

17:19.700 --> 17:20.700
The Kai Forest.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.910
The enemy is probably
lying in ambush there.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.810
Well done, Ars.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.280
Now we can turn the tables on them.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.710
It's nothing. Thank you.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.220
Alright, let's set off.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.590
Burn the ambushing soldiers
along with the forest.

17:37.880 --> 17:38.600
Yes.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.710
You used the strategy
I came up with before.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.330
You are still too green.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.610
This time will be another win for me.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.690
In terms of tactics,

17:52.690 --> 17:56.600
the most important thing is to know
how much the opponent can see through.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.390
Only those who understand
the intelligence of the opponent

17:59.390 --> 18:01.500
and see through the opponent

18:01.500 --> 18:03.620
can win in war.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.000
(Kai Forest)
The enemy troops led by Tomas

18:07.000 --> 18:08.790
came to Kai Forest near Belzud

18:08.790 --> 18:11.120
just as Mireille and the others predicted.

18:12.310 --> 18:13.800
But now,

18:13.800 --> 18:17.490
the one who knows
the enemy best is not Mireille,

18:17.490 --> 18:19.010
but Tomas.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.810
Just wait and see, Mireille.

18:22.310 --> 18:25.100
You must have guessed that
we sent soldiers to ambush

18:25.100 --> 18:27.890
and plan to burn down the entire forest.

18:27.890 --> 18:29.810
You think you've won.

18:30.390 --> 18:34.490
But throughout the forest,

18:34.490 --> 18:36.840
we've placed magical devices

18:37.810 --> 18:40.300
that will explode upon contacting flames.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.910
It will inflict great damage on you.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.300
It's an outstanding battle plan
that sees through the enemy.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.410
Lord Tomas is amazing.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.580
It's all set up.

18:52.590 --> 18:53.500
Very good.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.500
Now, I will tell you the real battle plan.

18:58.290 --> 19:00.610
The enemy's numbers
are several times ours.

19:01.010 --> 19:03.500
Even if the explosion
takes down some of them,

19:03.500 --> 19:05.800
it won't stop their assault.

19:06.290 --> 19:08.210
Then it'd be meaningless.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.730
No, as long as there's an explosion,

19:10.730 --> 19:13.400
the enemy will be convinced
that their strategy is wrong.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.890
Do you want us to charge into the enemy

19:14.890 --> 19:17.310
in the midst of the explosion?

19:17.310 --> 19:18.100
Yes.

19:19.090 --> 19:19.990
Currently,

19:19.990 --> 19:22.800
we're at an overwhelming disadvantage.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.000
To turn the table,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.120
we must be prepared to die.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.710
The battle is a fight to the death.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.710
We probably won't
be able to return safely.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.880
Those who can't make up their minds

19:35.880 --> 19:38.130
should leave while I have my back turned.

19:44.690 --> 19:46.130
This is a dangerous plan.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.910
If we can't take the enemy leader's head,

19:48.910 --> 19:50.700
we may die in vain.

19:51.700 --> 19:52.520
But…

19:53.490 --> 19:54.510
I see.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.240
So you are Edward Grandione's…

20:01.410 --> 20:05.310
He was more dedicated
to our Duchy than anyone.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.120
I believe Edward is innocent.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.500
We've lost a valuable talent.

20:13.510 --> 20:14.880
At that moment,

20:14.890 --> 20:17.330
I swore loyalty to Lord Basamark.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.100
To secure victory for Lord Basamark,

20:21.100 --> 20:22.390
I will spare no effort.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.100
The battle plan
for Samook Castle was the same.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.210
I felt that self-destruction
was the last resort…

20:29.210 --> 20:32.520
I am always ready to face death.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.910
I did it all for Lord Basamark.

20:39.890 --> 20:43.110
This loyalty is an affirmation
of my father's beliefs,

20:44.200 --> 20:46.420
and also the key to
my victory over Mireille.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.600
Even if no one stays,

20:51.700 --> 20:52.910
I will go alone.

20:59.990 --> 21:01.130
You…

21:04.600 --> 21:05.630
Lord Tomas,

21:06.480 --> 21:09.600
just as you swore your loyalty
to Lord Basamark,

21:10.500 --> 21:13.920
we also swear our loyalty to you.

21:18.590 --> 21:20.700
Many of these people

21:20.700 --> 21:22.710
will likely not return alive.

21:23.690 --> 21:24.600
However,

21:24.600 --> 21:26.700
unlike a disorganized army,

21:26.700 --> 21:31.290
an army that fights with resolve is very strong.

21:32.810 --> 21:34.990
I am proud of you all.

21:38.890 --> 21:40.420
Take your positions!

21:42.900 --> 21:45.180
Charge in at the sound of the explosion!

21:45.180 --> 21:46.090
Yes!

21:50.090 --> 21:52.110
The Kai Forest is right ahead.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.140
Thanks to Rosell,

23:27.140 --> 23:28.690
we understood the enemy's purpose.

23:28.690 --> 23:29.300
Yes.

23:29.710 --> 23:33.780
However, the enemy may have strategies
beyond our expectations.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.210
We can't be careless,

23:35.210 --> 23:37.000
but Lord Ars will be alright.

23:37.390 --> 23:39.960
