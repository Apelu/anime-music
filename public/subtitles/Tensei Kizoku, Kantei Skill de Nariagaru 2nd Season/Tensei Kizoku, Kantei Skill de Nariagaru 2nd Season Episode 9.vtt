WEBVTT

00:01.796 --> 00:03.203
The general was defeated.

00:03.789 --> 00:06.609
(Rolto Castle)
Only a small handful of men
remained in the Rolto Castle.

00:06.609 --> 00:08.008
They easily surrendered.

00:08.594 --> 00:10.511
We entered the castle unhindered.

00:12.137 --> 00:15.015
(Episode 21: The Future of the Shadow)

00:15.016 --> 00:16.983
It was indeed a long battle.

00:16.984 --> 00:19.615
But at least we managed
to take Rolto Castle.

00:20.709 --> 00:22.294
How are our soldiers doing?

00:22.295 --> 00:22.889
Oh.

00:23.506 --> 00:26.819
Those with serious injuries have been
sent back to their homelands to recover.

00:27.202 --> 00:29.988
Those with less serious wounds
have been treated by field medics

00:29.988 --> 00:29.989
Those with less serious wounds
have been treated by field medics
and are recovering.

00:29.989 --> 00:32.705
and are recovering.

00:32.912 --> 00:34.001
I see.

00:34.002 --> 00:38.197
So we'll just have to wait for Lord Curran
to come back from Staatz Castle.

00:38.198 --> 00:39.025
Hey.

00:39.299 --> 00:41.096
This time my award

00:41.097 --> 00:44.002
should be 10 gold coins
and 30 silver coins.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.198
That's one less silver coin.

00:47.198 --> 00:48.338
I'm sorry!

00:48.338 --> 00:49.966
Perhaps I was so busy

00:49.967 --> 00:52.104
that I erred in my calculations
after the battle ended!

00:52.105 --> 00:54.892
Hey, hey, let's get serious.

00:54.893 --> 00:57.760
I will certainly get my money back,
even if it is just a single copper coin!

00:58.198 --> 00:59.697
I'll be more careful!

00:59.698 --> 01:00.597
Right.

01:01.901 --> 01:04.307
Mr. Fahm is so meticulous.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.526
Oh right, Mr. Fahm.

01:06.526 --> 01:08.510
For the next quest…

01:10.002 --> 01:13.212
I would like you to inform
Lord Curran of our victory.

01:13.213 --> 01:16.326
And you also need to investigate the current
battle situation at Staatz Castle.

01:16.697 --> 01:17.830
Can you help us with that?

01:18.705 --> 01:20.501
I've told you before…

01:20.502 --> 01:22.611
No task is impossible for me.

01:23.596 --> 01:25.919
But to sacrifice my vacation for work,

01:26.408 --> 01:29.111
I need to get another bag as payment.

01:41.312 --> 01:44.103
(As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I'll Use
My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World S2)

02:55.092 --> 03:00.014
(As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I'll Use
My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World S2)

03:00.596 --> 03:03.916
(A New Threat)

03:03.916 --> 03:03.917
(A New Threat)
We are about to reach the location
where the supply unit is located.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.697
We are about to reach the location
where the supply unit is located.

03:07.104 --> 03:07.706
Um…

03:10.901 --> 03:13.607
I am not trying to be critical
of your methods, boss.

03:14.182 --> 03:16.815
We are just merely employees
who are paid to do our jobs.

03:17.401 --> 03:18.799
I think it could hurt that young master

03:18.799 --> 03:21.034
if we put too much emotion into it.

03:21.987 --> 03:23.807
I know what you're trying to say.

03:24.283 --> 03:27.323
But Lamberg is now winning battle
after battle.

03:27.324 --> 03:28.408
He's very generous.

03:29.018 --> 03:31.314
- And I feel that he…
- Boss!

03:32.502 --> 03:33.908
The situation of the camp…

03:34.502 --> 03:35.127
Hmm…

03:37.705 --> 03:39.713
(Curran Army, Supplies Storage Area)
Hurry! Get the supplies out of there!

03:40.198 --> 03:41.409
Put it out!

03:44.189 --> 03:46.884
Hurry up, or everything
will be burned down!

03:46.893 --> 03:47.519
Hey!

03:48.291 --> 03:49.916
W-Who are you?

03:50.291 --> 03:54.120
I am a mercenary employed by
Lord Ars Louvent of Lamberg

03:54.121 --> 03:55.604
to deliver a message.

03:56.010 --> 03:56.799
What happened?

03:57.198 --> 03:58.416
I-I see.

03:59.095 --> 04:00.901
The enemy came out of nowhere

04:00.902 --> 04:02.829
and burned our supplies.

04:03.291 --> 04:06.502
We've received reports that all the other
supply units have also been attacked.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.517
How much was lost?

04:09.409 --> 04:10.908
We've most likely lost

04:11.589 --> 04:14.510
more than half of both our supplies
and magic water.

04:15.695 --> 04:19.111
It seems now is not the time
to go looking for Curran.

04:19.916 --> 04:21.603
Send a message to Ars immediately!

04:22.220 --> 04:24.222
(Staatz Castle)

04:24.883 --> 04:28.000
(Belzud County Chief, Kanzes Bandol)
I think the ambush was a success.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.087
Well done, Tomas.

04:30.088 --> 04:32.088
(Tomas Grandione)
Pretty harsh.

04:32.088 --> 04:34.399
Lord Curran is cautious of this,

04:34.399 --> 04:36.924
that's why he's decentralizing
the storage.

04:38.799 --> 04:40.830
But we destroyed most of it.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.096
But this Staatz Castle

04:44.097 --> 04:46.409
has tens of thousands
of soldiers stationed here

04:46.409 --> 04:48.293
and is well fortified.

04:48.299 --> 04:52.095
Wouldn't it have been better to not
destroy the magic water?

04:52.096 --> 04:53.721
Lord Kanses.

04:54.510 --> 04:57.112
Magic is the main factor in this battle.

04:57.112 --> 04:59.611
Even a castle
in a strong position could fall.

05:00.510 --> 05:05.112
Especially they have so much
explosive magic water.

05:05.698 --> 05:07.010
I see.

05:07.596 --> 05:11.017
However, we can take it easy for a while now.

05:11.995 --> 05:14.213
After losing the magic water and supplies,

05:14.690 --> 05:16.604
the war will turn into a war of attrition.

05:17.409 --> 05:19.720
When winter arrives,

05:19.721 --> 05:21.533
we will have the victory.

05:22.096 --> 05:25.204
So all we have to do is wait?

05:25.205 --> 05:27.697
No, Curran Army

05:27.698 --> 05:29.698
is sure to hatch some kind of plan.

05:30.416 --> 05:33.510
So we will strike the enemy's weak point
before he can put it into action.

05:33.510 --> 05:36.024
We must firmly grasp victory.

05:36.025 --> 05:37.212
Weak point?

05:37.893 --> 05:40.103
It's Lord Curran himself.

05:40.502 --> 05:42.087
Lord Curran himself?

05:42.088 --> 05:44.887
I don't mean to praise the enemy,

05:44.888 --> 05:47.017
but Lord Curran is a formidable man.

05:47.705 --> 05:50.516
And that is his weak point.

05:51.190 --> 05:54.291
Lord Curran ought to be
safe and sound in Semplar

05:54.291 --> 05:54.292
Lord Curran ought to be
safe and sound in Semplar
while leaving the front lines
to his vassals.

05:54.292 --> 05:56.611
while leaving the front lines
to his vassals.

05:57.409 --> 06:01.095
But because he's so formidable,
he can't leave it to others,

06:01.096 --> 06:04.205
that's why he personally takes
to the battlefield to command.

06:05.010 --> 06:06.909
Looking at it another way,

06:06.910 --> 06:09.307
this is our chance to defeat him.

06:09.892 --> 06:12.205
That would be great.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.308
But aren't his surroundings
firmly guarded?

06:15.309 --> 06:16.504
Is it possible?

06:16.895 --> 06:18.411
Leave it to me.

06:19.301 --> 06:22.613
I lost to them once before.

06:23.705 --> 06:27.088
And I'm so prideful that

06:27.088 --> 06:27.089
And I'm so prideful that
I won't rest until they're
in their graves.

06:27.089 --> 06:29.932
I won't rest until they're
in their graves.

06:32.002 --> 06:33.935
That's reassuring.

06:34.955 --> 06:36.299
(Rolto Castle)

06:36.300 --> 06:39.807
Lord Curran lost his supplies
and magic water?

06:40.190 --> 06:42.402
Shadow said

06:42.402 --> 06:44.291
the supply units stationed

06:44.291 --> 06:47.338
three kilometers southwest

06:47.338 --> 06:48.627
of Lord Curran's main army were attacked.

06:50.213 --> 06:52.306
If they lose their supplies,

06:52.307 --> 06:54.909
it could lead to a prolonged battle.

06:55.495 --> 06:58.908
Even though Lord Curran
must also be very alert,

06:58.909 --> 07:01.705
the ambush still worked.

07:02.198 --> 07:03.604
Could it be…

07:04.198 --> 07:08.510
My little brother Tomas
must be behind this.

07:10.494 --> 07:12.198
The man we fought in Samuk Castle

07:12.199 --> 07:15.103
who tried to make Selina
and her father blow themselves up.

07:16.895 --> 07:17.995
Winter is coming,

07:17.996 --> 07:19.898
so there's no way
they can fight for long, right?

07:19.898 --> 07:21.525
We have to hurry and go help them.

07:21.893 --> 07:23.705
I'll prepare the troops right away.

07:23.995 --> 07:26.611
Now, now, calm down.

07:27.096 --> 07:29.189
Anything else?

07:29.190 --> 07:29.825
Yes.

07:30.682 --> 07:32.120
Enemy's magic unit has been spotted

07:32.120 --> 07:36.300
to bring a large catalyst to Mount Tohrai.

07:37.002 --> 07:38.124
Mount Tohrai?

07:38.705 --> 07:41.117
Lord Curran is there.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.611
It should just be within viewing distance
from the main army.

07:45.315 --> 07:47.698
Lord Curran can't use magic attacks

07:47.699 --> 07:50.315
without magic water.

07:50.315 --> 07:52.588
And the enemy uses its mage

07:52.589 --> 07:53.901
that was planned for defense to attack…

07:54.791 --> 07:57.814
Aren't they planning to attack with magic
from the mountain?

07:59.203 --> 07:59.922
No.

08:00.399 --> 08:02.703
It's too far away.

08:02.704 --> 08:04.712
No offensive magic could reach.

08:05.696 --> 08:06.820
That makes sense.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.009
I think

08:09.010 --> 08:12.111
that if this goes on, Curran will soon
prepare himself to die.

08:14.391 --> 08:15.727
What do you mean?

08:16.492 --> 08:19.615
Shadow should still be close
to that supply unit, right?

08:20.102 --> 08:23.016
(Curran Army, Supplies Storage Area)
Tell them to hurry to base camp of Curran.

08:29.290 --> 08:30.509
That's the message we received.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.304
What?

08:32.805 --> 08:35.110
They want us to save Curran?

08:35.508 --> 08:37.695
That's a bit much, don't you think?

08:37.696 --> 08:39.477
But at this rate,

08:39.478 --> 08:41.399
Lord Curran's life is in danger!

08:41.797 --> 08:43.690
Besides, is this true?

08:43.690 --> 08:44.516
Next…

08:49.501 --> 08:51.495
According to my prediction,

08:51.496 --> 08:52.807
they will most likely

08:53.315 --> 08:54.510
make it rain.

08:55.612 --> 08:58.057
It didn't make sense they positioned

08:58.058 --> 09:00.612
their precious mage in a place
they couldn't attack from.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.619
But then I thought of something.

09:04.307 --> 09:07.315
The spell that makes it rain
is called just "Rain."

09:07.901 --> 09:09.823
It could be used to generate rain clouds

09:09.823 --> 09:11.901
at a high point and make it rain
at Curran's camp.

09:12.401 --> 09:15.901
After all, it's simple to gather
water manastones in Belzud.

09:16.307 --> 09:19.002
Why would that threaten Lord Curran?

09:19.815 --> 09:21.401
This is not normal rain.

09:21.892 --> 09:23.213
It can summon torrential showers

09:23.214 --> 09:25.807
in a small area in a short time.

09:26.409 --> 09:28.409
The land where Curran is encamped

09:28.994 --> 09:31.112
has poor roads

09:31.112 --> 09:33.616
and the soil easily gets muddy,

09:33.617 --> 09:35.112
so they'll be completely immobilized.

09:37.307 --> 09:40.330
They will be in a terrible panic.

09:40.815 --> 09:42.509
They won't be able to see anything

09:42.510 --> 09:44.626
more than a few meters away.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.518
Nor will they hear anything
thanks to the sound of the rain falling.

09:48.307 --> 09:51.518
Isn't that perfect for an assassination?

09:53.909 --> 09:56.400
It's really raining.

09:56.401 --> 09:58.206
Just like that woman said.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.308
No choice, let's hurry!

10:04.312 --> 10:06.502
(Curran Army, Base Camp,
Commander's Quarter)

10:07.010 --> 10:08.510
What awful rain.

10:10.415 --> 10:11.798
(Ambush)

10:11.799 --> 10:13.002
What now?

10:13.002 --> 10:15.393
Looks like the cavalry unit has returned
from the frontlines.

10:20.807 --> 10:22.330
No, it's the enemy!

10:25.010 --> 10:26.518
Darn! An ambush!

10:27.198 --> 10:29.119
How did the enemy make it into our camp?

10:30.096 --> 10:31.213
This rain…

10:32.190 --> 10:33.916
That's right, it's magic.

10:34.791 --> 10:35.814
Is it Rain?

10:37.096 --> 10:39.221
Are they planning to take my head?

10:41.807 --> 10:43.205
I like your guts.

10:46.995 --> 10:49.011
Everyone! To arms!

10:50.205 --> 10:51.901
Drive them back!

10:58.104 --> 11:00.713
Lord Curran! A single rider broke through!

11:05.299 --> 11:07.010
Long time no see, Tomas.

11:07.510 --> 11:09.002
Is my little brother doing well?

11:09.799 --> 11:11.104
Lord Curran…

11:11.893 --> 11:14.205
I will take your life!

11:20.064 --> 11:21.198
Got it!

11:28.705 --> 11:29.799
Men!

11:29.799 --> 11:32.430
Curran is here! Kill him!

11:44.907 --> 11:46.828
What now? It's pitch dark?

11:47.493 --> 11:48.813
Can't see anything.

11:49.399 --> 11:50.626
Is it the enemy's magic?

11:53.220 --> 11:55.618
Stay calm, this is shadow magic.

11:56.212 --> 11:57.217
Who are you?

11:57.217 --> 11:58.102
Be quiet.

11:58.602 --> 12:00.804
Ars hired me to save you.

12:00.805 --> 12:02.727
We're running away, so come with me.

12:06.204 --> 12:07.712
Ars sent you for support?

12:07.712 --> 12:08.789
Yes.

12:08.790 --> 12:11.907
It looks like Ars is also getting troops
ready to come here.

12:12.907 --> 12:15.026
So Ars anticipated this ambush?

12:15.805 --> 12:17.319
And this magic

12:17.993 --> 12:19.719
is the shadow magic

12:19.720 --> 12:22.103
that blocks the enemy's sight
by covering you in darkness.

12:23.516 --> 12:25.907
On top of consuming precious manastones,

12:26.313 --> 12:28.906
it even blocks the user's line of sight,

12:28.907 --> 12:31.542
so I heard it was extremely tricky to use.

12:32.509 --> 12:34.711
To think he found
such an excellent talent.

12:39.399 --> 12:42.024
You guys, take this man and escape.

12:42.891 --> 12:43.742
What about you, leader?

12:44.696 --> 12:47.999
Seems I was noticed
and the enemy's on our tail.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.508
I'll buy you some time.

12:50.899 --> 12:53.430
Follow them! Don't let Curran get away!

12:54.804 --> 12:55.898
Darn it!

12:55.899 --> 12:58.407
Didn't expect to be thwarted
at the very last moment!

12:59.290 --> 13:00.509
This is…

13:02.212 --> 13:04.407
Your ambush failed.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.290
Give up.

13:06.344 --> 13:08.246
Shadow magic again?

13:08.907 --> 13:10.946
But even though we can't see,

13:10.947 --> 13:12.602
we can still detect you.

13:13.196 --> 13:15.212
If we just focus on sound,

13:15.213 --> 13:16.821
he won't catch us!

13:17.501 --> 13:19.595
Attack him!

13:19.595 --> 13:20.213
Yes, sir!

13:24.305 --> 13:26.602
He completely erased
all traces of himself, huh?

13:27.610 --> 13:28.407
But…

13:32.001 --> 13:34.797
I'm the right-hand man of Basamark.

13:34.798 --> 13:37.009
You'd better not look down on me.

13:51.009 --> 13:52.009
Over there?

13:58.798 --> 14:00.688
What a nimble one.

14:00.688 --> 14:00.689
What a nimble one.
Lord Tomas, if this continues…

14:00.689 --> 14:03.117
Lord Tomas, if this continues…

14:03.118 --> 14:04.235
I know.

14:05.399 --> 14:07.797
Curran has probably escaped.

14:07.798 --> 14:10.103
Even if we catch up now,
we can't kill him.

14:12.204 --> 14:14.812
Abort the plan! Retreat!

14:21.219 --> 14:23.001
Seems I managed to hold him off somehow.

14:24.407 --> 14:26.899
(Curran Army, Base Camp,
Commander's Quarter)

14:26.899 --> 14:28.211
Listen up, everyone!

14:28.595 --> 14:31.312
The enemy general has set out
from the castle to attack us.

14:31.313 --> 14:32.305
This is our best chance.

14:33.391 --> 14:35.719
We must attack Staatz Castle immediately!

14:36.102 --> 14:38.110
Everyone, be prepared to deploy!

14:43.298 --> 14:45.427
As expected of a top-notch general.

14:45.805 --> 14:49.524
Usually people would need to
reorganize their troops, though.

14:50.907 --> 14:52.289
Our job is done.

14:52.290 --> 14:54.000
Let's go back and get the money.

14:54.001 --> 14:54.634
Shadow.

14:56.993 --> 14:58.523
Thank you for saving me.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.305
I'd like to thank you.

15:01.009 --> 15:02.103
Would these be enough?

15:04.016 --> 15:05.210
Oh my, that's a lot.

15:05.211 --> 15:06.906
I believe that your hard work

15:06.916 --> 15:09.618
fully deserves these rewards.

15:10.102 --> 15:13.118
In case this is not sufficient,

15:13.915 --> 15:17.134
I would like to appoint you
as my direct reports.

15:20.102 --> 15:22.594
Followers of the next
Duchy of Missian, huh?

15:23.016 --> 15:25.024
In order to survive the impending mayhem,

15:25.407 --> 15:28.704
I will most certainly require
a shadow unit such as yours.

15:29.399 --> 15:32.719
Each day will be exciting, I promise.

15:33.110 --> 15:33.712
It's fine.

15:34.407 --> 15:35.618
I don't need a reward.

15:36.407 --> 15:38.101
Are you dissatisfied with the amount?

15:38.102 --> 15:39.204
It's not that.

15:39.907 --> 15:42.407
Because you weren't
the employer this time.

15:43.001 --> 15:44.204
It is that young master.

15:45.009 --> 15:47.525
I am going to ask that young master
for a lot of money.

15:50.212 --> 15:51.923
Because that's what the contract says.

15:54.501 --> 15:55.704
I have been rejected.

15:56.993 --> 15:58.313
Tell Ars that

15:58.712 --> 16:01.017
thanks to him, I got my life back.

16:02.009 --> 16:02.704
Also…

16:03.110 --> 16:07.001
Shadow will probably ask him
for a hefty reward.

16:13.204 --> 16:15.009
His proposal isn't bad.

16:15.610 --> 16:17.704
Is it worth giving it more thought?

16:32.110 --> 16:34.595
I have a wife and a kid!

16:34.596 --> 16:36.508
Please, spare me!

16:37.196 --> 16:38.727
That's irrelevant.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.220
Sorry, but this is my job.

16:42.712 --> 16:43.728
You devil!

16:56.610 --> 16:57.516
It's you.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.023
Take it.

17:00.907 --> 17:01.610
Listen carefully.

17:02.009 --> 17:03.704
You absolutely cannot share
my information…

17:03.704 --> 17:05.899
Keeping the employer under wraps.

17:06.501 --> 17:07.813
Because that's what the contract says.

17:08.813 --> 17:10.281
Right.

17:10.282 --> 17:12.297
If other people saw you,
it would be terrible.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.825
Now get lost.

17:20.712 --> 17:24.212
(Ars Army's Camp)
Thank you so much for all you did this time!

17:24.805 --> 17:27.719
To add to his gratitude, Lord Curran
contacted me to express his appreciation.

17:27.720 --> 17:28.423
Hmm…

17:29.188 --> 17:30.633
And um…

17:31.102 --> 17:33.602
He also said this time Mr. Fahm might ask

17:33.602 --> 17:37.508
for a hefty reward.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.516
Yeah.

17:40.399 --> 17:41.390
Huh?

17:41.391 --> 17:42.921
Mr. Fahm, your left arm…

17:44.907 --> 17:45.602
This is…

17:45.602 --> 17:46.815
Are you okay?

17:47.305 --> 17:48.703
This is bad.

17:48.704 --> 17:50.712
Did you properly disinfect it?

17:51.415 --> 17:53.126
A lot of blood is coming out.

17:53.618 --> 17:55.116
Have you got a new bandage?

17:56.907 --> 17:57.727
Mr. Fahm?

17:59.195 --> 18:00.906
We Shadow

18:00.907 --> 18:03.414
have always lived a life
as members of the mercenary group.

18:04.305 --> 18:06.297
All of us

18:06.298 --> 18:09.712
are wanderers and criminals as well.

18:10.501 --> 18:11.696
We live off

18:12.040 --> 18:14.798
of dirty work, and we accept any job.

18:16.290 --> 18:19.993
Even murder, we also do it.

18:20.798 --> 18:21.509
Right.

18:23.298 --> 18:25.712
Ars, are you scared of me?

18:29.211 --> 18:31.898
Scared? What for?

18:31.899 --> 18:34.313
I've never once thought you were scary.

18:35.399 --> 18:37.867
Your work performance
always exceeds expectations.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.415
And I can always count on you.

18:42.219 --> 18:45.624
In your absence,
we would have already lost.

18:46.399 --> 18:48.415
I'm really grateful to you!

18:50.415 --> 18:52.509
But your award is a little high…

18:59.798 --> 19:02.725
B-Boss is laughing out loud…

19:04.509 --> 19:05.812
I see.

19:05.813 --> 19:08.305
Then, why don't you pay me

19:09.609 --> 19:11.717
by making me your vassal?

19:14.008 --> 19:15.297
Huh?

19:16.703 --> 19:19.391
W-What do you mean?

19:19.392 --> 19:20.797
Exactly what I said.

19:20.798 --> 19:23.219
All of Shadow would be
working directly for you.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.331
Boss, what are you talking about?

19:26.009 --> 19:29.524
When I bet, I always do it
before other people.

19:30.008 --> 19:32.713
Making a bet when nobody is expecting

19:32.713 --> 19:33.713
and win big.

19:34.618 --> 19:37.125
He might not be much more
than a county chief for now,

19:37.618 --> 19:39.509
but eventually,

19:39.923 --> 19:42.406
this guy will be a great man,

19:42.407 --> 19:43.907
greater than anyone in Summerforth Empire.

19:45.797 --> 19:46.625
Also…

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
So?

19:53.001 --> 19:54.110
Do we have a deal?

19:54.501 --> 19:56.587
O-Of course!

19:56.587 --> 19:59.212
It should be me inviting you to join me!

19:59.797 --> 20:02.415
We don't mind if boss says so.

20:02.415 --> 20:04.312
We look forward to working
with you, young master.

20:04.313 --> 20:05.913
Thank you all.

20:08.407 --> 20:09.344
Also…

20:10.719 --> 20:12.008
You devil!

20:12.501 --> 20:13.992
Now get lost.

20:17.196 --> 20:18.805
When I'm together with him,

20:19.297 --> 20:20.516
I feel like

20:21.118 --> 20:23.212
I'm still a human.

20:27.305 --> 20:28.516
Ars Louvent.

20:29.094 --> 20:32.141
I hereby swear my loyalty to you.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.118
Y-You don't have to go so far.

20:39.407 --> 20:40.532
Thanks.

20:40.910 --> 20:42.430
That's super reassuring to have you.

20:43.602 --> 20:46.008
Let's keep getting along.

20:49.610 --> 20:52.334
(Staatz Castle)

20:53.009 --> 20:55.321
We couldn't kill Lord Curran.

20:55.610 --> 20:59.094
But they lost their suppliers
and magic water.

20:59.095 --> 21:02.110
All we have to do is hole up
inside the castle.

21:02.407 --> 21:03.626
They'll run away

21:03.627 --> 21:06.110
as soon as it snows.

21:09.805 --> 21:11.509
This is so boring.

21:11.899 --> 21:15.110
Hey, hey, there's a brat with a sad face.

21:16.664 --> 21:18.625
Go drink some milk.

21:18.899 --> 21:22.219
That's a large spear you've got, brat!

21:22.602 --> 21:23.805
Think it makes you look cool?

21:24.914 --> 21:28.399
Such a spear is wasted on you.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.813
So I'll take it.

21:30.102 --> 21:31.813
You idiot, that…

21:36.712 --> 21:38.821
W-What's with this weight?

21:40.501 --> 21:42.313
You better stop now.

21:43.509 --> 21:44.509
Good grief.

21:49.399 --> 21:53.711
This doesn't belong in
the hands of weaklings like you.

23:26.001 --> 23:28.603
Have I not had many chances
to show off lately?

23:28.604 --> 23:30.125
T-That's not true.

23:30.695 --> 23:31.610
Not at all.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.344
Shadow has joined us?

23:33.345 --> 23:35.000
I guess my part's going to get lesser.

23:35.891 --> 23:38.296
If that's the case, take this!
